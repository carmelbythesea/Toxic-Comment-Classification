# Toxic-Comment-Classification

This project is designed to classify toxic comments from Wikipedia into 6 types. We used common classifiers Logistic regression, Isolation Forest and Multinomial Naive Bayes. We also used neural network CNN and LSTM to train the classification model.

## Getting started

Download python 3 on the computer and download the code and packages listed below to your local machine to setup the model

### Prerequisites

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook 
- Numpy Pandas 
- Matplotlib 
- Sklearn
- SciPy
- 
### Installing

First to install python 3 onto your computer 

Then to install all the packages needed to run the programs

`pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn scipy`
`jupyter notebook` 


## Running tests

- For exploratory data analysis, run /eda_common_classifiers.ipynb
- For common classifiers Logistic regression, Isolation Forest and Multinomial Naive Bayes, run /eda_common_classifiers.ipynb
- For neural network CNN and LSTM, run /cnn.ipynb
